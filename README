scanflash: Utility for testing flash memory devices

This program writes and then verifies data on every block of a device, to
ensure that the data written is exactly what is read back.

It is designed to help test for fake memory cards and USB flash drives, which
often report their size to be much larger than it is in reality.  Usually the
start and end of these devices will hold data, so that simple tests like
copying files will appear to succeed, even though the data is silently being
lost.  This is because the area in the middle of the devices will either lose
data written to it, or it will overwrite data elsewhere on the device (which
makes detection harder, as you will always be able to read the data you just
wrote.)

scanflash works by writing unique codes across the entire device, and only once
the whole device has been filled does it attempt to read the data back again.
This allows it to detect the following types of problems:

 * Black holes, where data written just disappears.

 * Overlaps, where data written actually overwrites data elsewhere.

 * Corruption, where data can't be read or written properly.

Rather than just identifying bad devices, scanflash will try to figure out
which parts of the storage device are unusable.  It will then create a special
partition around the bad data, preventing it from being used.  Partitions are
created to provide access to the rest of the space, so that the card can still
be used, albeit with a smaller capacity than what it says on its label.
